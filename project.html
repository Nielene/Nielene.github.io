				<h3>Kiva</h3>
				<p>In San Francisco, back in 2005, an international nonprofit called Kiva was created. They envision a world where all people hold the power to create opportunity for themselves and others. They realized that though dreams are universal, opportunity is not. They seek to rethink how we give - to go beyond charity.
				<p>Their mission is to alleviate poverty by connecting people through lending. They celebrate and support people looking to create a better future for themselves, their families and their communities. By lending as little as $25 on Kiva, anyone can help a borrower start or grow a business, go to school, access clean energy or realize their potential. For some, it’s a matter of survival, for others it’s the fuel for a life-long ambition.</p>
				<p>100% of every dollar you lend on Kiva goes to funding loans. Kiva covers costs primarily through optional donations, as well as through support from grants and sponsors.
